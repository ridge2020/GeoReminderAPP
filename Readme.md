## APP name: Locatnetic
## Summary:
How many times have you said to yourself "When I get home, I need to do this task", and then
forget? This application will look to solve this problem by making sure that we are reminded when
we arrive home to do that task. The hope also is to add additional functionality to increase the
user base widely enough to offer services to businesses and events looking to take advantage of
Geo-Fenced advertising and promotions. Just arrived at your favorite store? You receive an offer
valid for your visit as a push notification. Driving near an event center and like music (based on
visiting related stores/events)? Here is a small push notification of upcoming events in that
location. Attending an event? Great, here is a filter for your camera to share with your other
social media. Geolocation is a huge boon and this application is looking to offer it's users with
a unique experience based on their travels.
